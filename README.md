# bird-house-putt-putt
Converted a birdhouse into a putt putt golf hole. When a putt is made a buzzer sounds and LEDs light up.

Bought a birdhouse from local thrift shop to use as the putt putt feature. Cut a notch in the bottom front for the "hole" using a drill press and skill saw. Used an arduino nano to drive the electronics. I had a strip of LED lights laying around to use for celebratory lights, as well as an active buzzer from an old electronics kit. They could all be electrically driven directly from the nano output pins. For the touch sensor I used a small bit of residential 14/2 copper wire as a swinging bar and contact area (see pictures). The whole project took about 9 hours.
